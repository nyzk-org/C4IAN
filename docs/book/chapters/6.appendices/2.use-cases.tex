C4IAN is designed to provide infrastructure-less wireless communications for tactical teams. It provides the following services for command centers and units, who can be moving freely:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
    \item Exchanging code messages between units and command centers.
    \item Exchanging audio messages between units and command centers.
    \item Assigning units to groups, and sending audio messages from command centers to a specific groups (multicasting), or to all units (broadcasting).
    \item Streaming sensors' data (location, heartbeat, etc.) from units to command centers.
    \item Streaming videos from combat cameras at the units to command centers on-demand.
    \item Recording and visualizing all communications history with different units at command centers.
\end{itemize}

These services are provided by the implemented clients for command centers and units. However, the underlying router is a generic MANET router that can be easily used for further applications by modifying or extending the software clients. Some examples are:

    \item Controlling fleets of drones or autonomous vehicles.
    \item Providing communications for smart robots with decentralized coordination.
    \item Aggregating sensors data from moving vehicles.
\end{itemize}
