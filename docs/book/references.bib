abstract = {On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) is a multicast routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. Its efficiency, simplicity, and robustness to mobility render it one of the most widely used MANET multicast protocols. At the heart of the ODMRP’s robustness is the periodic route refreshing. ODMRP rebuilds the data forwarding “mesh” on a fixed interval and thus the route refresh interval is a key parameter that has critical impact on the network performance. If the route refresh rate is too high, the network will undergo too much routing overhead, wasting valuable resources. If it is too low, ODMRP cannot keep up with network dynamics, resulting in packet losses due to route breakages. In this paper, we present an enhancement of ODMRP with the refresh rate dynamically adapted to the environment. Simulation results show that the Enhanced ODMRP (E-ODMRP) reduces the packet overhead by up to a half yet keeping a packet delivery ratio comparable to that of the original ODMRP. E-ODMRP compares favorably with other published multicast schemes.}

abstract = {Application layer multicasting has emerged as an appealing alternative to network layer multicasting in wireline networks. Here, we examine the suitability of application layer multicast in ad hoc networks. To this effect, we propose a flexible receiver-driven overlay multicast protocol which we call Application Layer Multicast Algorithm (ALMA). ALMA constructs an overlay multicast tree in a dynamic, decentralized and incremental way. First, ALMA is receiver-driven: the member nodes find their connections according to their needs. Second, it is flexible, and thus, it can satisfy the performance goals and the needs of a wide range of applications. Third, it is highly adaptive: it reconfigures the tree in response to mobility or congestion. In addition, our protocol has the advantages of an application layer protocol: (a) simplicity of deployment, (b) independence from lower layer protocols, and (c) capability of exploiting features such as reliability and security that may be provided by the lower layers. Through extensive simulations, we show that ALMA performs favorably against the currently best application layer and network layer protocols. In more detail, we find that ALMA performs significantly better than ODMRP, a network layer, for small group sizes. We conclude that the application layer approach and ALMA seem very promising for ad hoc multicasting.}
